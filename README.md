# Bus-Tracker

An exercise that showed us how to apply Asynchronous coding and how to extract data from other servers via API. 
In this exercise we are asked to track public busses in real time. Specifically in the city of Boston. And with the data that we get, we show it in the UI using Mapbox. 

I have to say this is a very challenging exercise for me. I have yet to learn more about fetching API and using the data to integrate it on the map. I have only manage to track bus stops and it is not in real time. 

Roadmap or future improvements: Needs more improvement. I need to learn how to use the Fetched API data to use it in the function. This is one of the exercises that I got stuck on.
